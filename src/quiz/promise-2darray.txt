Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

1. "Sum called..." - The code calls the sum2DArray function and as a result the console.log prints 
2. "returning from sum" - is printed after the setTimeout is called, the rest of the function continues to run 
3. "sumPromis1"... - the function called returns a Promise but is still pending and running asynchronously
4. Steps 1 and 2 are then repeated when sum2DArray([]) is called
5. This time the function enters the .catch block and returns an error
6. Now the async function continues to log each time addition happens 
7. Then the .then block is called and results in printing the sum
